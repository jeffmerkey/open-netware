This is a very old project that is provided for historical purposes.  The program is built from Borland Turbo C DOS compiler 
with PVCS and the PharLap assembler.  This code can be ported to use gcc but since very large portions of the code is 
written in assembly language, moving this project to the gcc assembler would be a significant undertaking.  The makefiles
are more easily converted, but this code base is very old and is developed and booted from DOS.  It is provided to show
how NetWare SMP was built for the sake of history since Novell never made any of it's technology public, and this code
base is from the old DOS and Netware days,
